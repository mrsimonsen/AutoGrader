<p>Now that you're done with Crash Course: Computer Science, let's do a crash course in programming. Over the next two weeks you'll be creating, testing, and modifying a simple program written in Python.</p>
<h2>Part 1 - Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Creating a GitHub Account</h3>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) for tracking changes to projects, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, a service for projects that use Git.</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a> and sign up for an account.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>I don't care what email you use</li>
<li>I don't care what your username is, but these are public so keep them appropriate.</li>
<li>If it asks, choose the free account</li>
<li>When it asks you questions about yourself, that is optional</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Check your email and verify your your account.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Creating a Repl.it Account</h3>
<p>We'll be using Repl.it as our in-browser IDE, so we don't need to set up personal computers and get to enjoy the auto-saving features.</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> and sign up for an account using your <strong>GitHub</strong> credentials (middle icon between Google and Facebook).</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><em>This is very important! If your accounts aren't linked - things won't work!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Grant permission for Repl.it to access your GitHub account</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>When it asks you questions about yourself, that is optional</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Accept assignment from GitHub Classroom</h3>
<p>Before we can start coding we need to get the assignment repository. GitHub Classroom provides an easy way for me to distribute all the assignment code and details: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/GWx3AocH">CSP-solar-trivia</a>. Click the green "Accept this assignment" button and GitHub will make a repository for you with all the assignment code in it. Click on the link to view your repository (repo for short) on GitHub's website.</p>

<h3>Repo Breakdown - What're all these files?</h3>
<p>Accessing Code on Repl.it - plus troubleshooting</p>
<h2>Part 2 - Code and Test 1</h2>
<p>variable creation</p>
<p>input statement</p>
<p>Data types (string vs int vs float) and int() conversion</p>
<p>print statement</p>
<p>fstrings</p>
<p>math</p>
<p>round()</p>
<p>You'll need to enter data into your program to complete it. We'll be needing data from the 7 other planets in our Solar System (Pluto's a dwarf planet - skip it) which we will get from the <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planetary Fact Sheet - Ratio to Earth Values</a> from NASA. Well need the planets' names, gravities, and orbital periods.</p>
<p>follow along part 1</p>
<p>test part 1</p>
<p>commit part 1</p>
<h2>Part 3 - Code and Test 2</h2>
<p>for loops</p>
<p>tuples w/ indexing</p>
<p>fstring formatting</p>
<p>follow along part 2</p>
<p>test part 2</p>
<p>commit part 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Part 4 - Modification</h2>
<p>modification info - figure it out &amp;&nbsp;test yourself using website</p>
<p>Extend the program to calculate how many planetary rotations (days) for each planet. Use the absolute value of the Rotation Period from the Planetary Fact Sheet. Your test doesn't cover the modification part of the assignment. You can use this website - <a href="https://theplanets.org/age-on-planets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Planets</a> - to check your math for planetary days (not quite exact, but close enough).</p>
