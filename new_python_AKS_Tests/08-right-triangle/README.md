# 08-right-triangle

(1) Modify the program to output a right triangle that instead uses the user-specified tri\_char character.

(2) Modify the program to output a right triangle of height tri\_height. The first line will have one user-specified character, such as % or \*. Each subsequent line will have one additional user-specified character until the number in the triangle's base reaches tri\_height. Output a space after each user-specified character, including after the line's last user-specified character.


Example output for tri\_char = % and tri\_height = 5:
```
Enter a character:
%
Enter triangle height:
5

%
% %
% % %
% % % %
% % % % %
```
