This program will output a right triangle based on user specified height tri_height and symbol tri_char.

(1) The given program outputs a fixed-height triangle using a * character. Modify the given program to output a right triangle that instead uses the user-specified triangleChar character. (1 pt)



(2) Modify the program to use a nested loop to output a right triangle of height tri_height. The first line will have one user-specified character, such as % or \*. Each subsequent line will have one additional user-specified character until the number in the triangle's base reaches tri_height. Output a space after each user-specified character, including after the line's last user-specified character. (2 pts)



Example output for tri_char = % and tri_height = 5:
```
Enter a character:
%
Enter triangle height:
5

%
% %
% % %
% % % %
% % % % %
```
