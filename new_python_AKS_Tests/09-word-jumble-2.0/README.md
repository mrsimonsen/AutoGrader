# 07-word-jumble-2.0

You'll be improving the Word Jumble game so that each word is paired with a hint. You may also change the word list to be whatever you want.

Modify setup() so that it picks a random word and it's associated hint - you may need to change how the random word is picked so that the word and hint match.

Modify guessing() so that the player can type 'hint' to see the hint and the hint_used variable changes to True.

Modify end() to that the text matches the test if a hint is used or not.
