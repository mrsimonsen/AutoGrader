```
Enter a number: 1
Enter a second number: 2
Doing math for 1 and 2.
```
(2) Expand the program to preform seven mathematical operations in the order shown below.
```
Enter a number: 1
Enter a second number: 2
Doing math for 1 and 2.

Addition = 3
Subtraction = -1
Multiplication = 2
Exponent = 1
Division = 0.5
Floor Division = 0
Modulus Division = 1
```
(3) Expand the program to round the division to a maximum of 3 decimal places.
```
Enter a number: 333
Enter a second number: 11
Doing math for 333 and 11.

Addition = 344
Subtraction = 322
Multiplication = 3663
Exponent = 5583243494552763872208758517
Division = 30.273
