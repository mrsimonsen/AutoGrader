# 03-coin-flipper

Complete the coin() function so that when it's given an integer it will generate a random number between 0 and 1 the given number of times. Use branching to keep track of the total 0s (heads) and 1s (tails). Be aware of off-by-one errors; make sure your program runs the correct number of times.

## Example Test
```
The tests set the seed so that the random number generation matches an expected output.
coin(100) == (100,50,50)
```
