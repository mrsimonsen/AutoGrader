# 14-trivia-challenge-2.0

This is your final project.

You'll be making improvements to the trivia_challenge.py game. Modify the trivia.txt file by adding a point value to each question, and place it after the explanation line. You'll need to modify next_block() and main() to use this new value. Complete sortNsave() and hs_table() so they pass all tests.

I've included a support program reset_hs.py that can be used to reset the highscores.dat file or read its contents.

## Project Hints
* Make sure your read and understand the basic program before you start modifying it.
* Lines 87 - 93 have been commented out so the program will run before your modifications are in. Uncomment them to test your program.
