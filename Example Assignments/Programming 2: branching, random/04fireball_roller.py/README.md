# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to generate random numbers.

## Steps
1. Display the flavor text of Dungeon & Dragons 5e Fireball spell.
2. Simulate rolling 8 6-sided dice, storing them into their own variables. Display the results of each dice on a single line separated by spaces.
3. Display the total damage the spell did.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.
6 6 3 6 3 6 5 5
Total damage: 40
```
*Note: This program generates random numbers, your output will vary. I set the seed value for the tests so that the numbers will always be the same.*
