# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to use if/elif/else statements.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for an abbreviation.
2. Create branching statements that check the abbreviation against the table below. If the abbreviation is in the table, the program should output the expansion; otherwise it should output "Unknown". if/elif/else must be used for credit, separate if statements won't count.
3. Force the input to always be in uppercase.

abbreviation | expansion
 :--: | --
 BFF | best friend forever
IDK | I don't know
IMHO | in my humble opinion
JK | just kidding
LOL | laughing out loud
TMI | too much information

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Input an abbreviation:
LOL
laughing out loud
```
```
Input an abbreviation:
ABC
Unknown
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
