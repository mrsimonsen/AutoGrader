# Instructions
Objective: Lean about f-string width, precision, and flags.

## Steps
1. Output the given integer "num" using f-strings to display if the number is positive or negative, with a minimum width of 5, padding with spaces.
2. Output the given float "flt" using f-strings to have a min width of 10, padding with 0s, and a forced precision of 5.
3. Output the given string "str" 3 times on the same line in the same f-string. Have the first occurrence left justified with a min width of 10, and the last occurrence right justified with a min width of 10. Give the middle occurrence a max width of 5.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
 +303
0012.34000
Format    Forma    Format
```
