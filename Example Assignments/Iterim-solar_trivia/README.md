# Instructions  
Objective: Interim assignment to get your brain switched back to programming in python. The tests for this assignment will not be visible - you must manually check your code.

## Steps
1. Replace the section 1 TODO comment with code that looks like the following:
	```
	Enter Name:
	Simonsen
	Input birth year (YYYY):
	1988
	Input birth month (MM):
	3
	Input birth day (DD):
	1
	Enter weight:
	275

	Solar System data for Simonsen
	```
	*Note: This section outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
2. Complete the TODO table, replacing all 0s with their corresponding values from all 8 planets in our solar system (sorry Pluto). Use the planets names, gravities, orbital periods, and rotational periods from [Planetary Fact Sheet - Ratio to Earth Values](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html).
	
3. Complete the three TODOs in the for loop to calculate the user's age (orbital periods), weight, and number of days (rotations) for each planet.
	```
	...
	Solar System data for Simonsen
	Planet |Mercury|Venus  |Earth  |Mars   |Jupiter|Saturn |Uranus |Neptune|
	Age    |     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|
	Weight |     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|
	Days   |     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|     ##|
	```
	*Note: This example also does not show all of the expected planet outputs; you'll need to calculate what the values are for them.*

	[The Planets](https://theplanets.org/age-on-planets/) may be useful to check your algorithms for planetary days and age (the site uses different numbers than we are, so it's not quite exact to the numbers expected, but close enough for checking).
