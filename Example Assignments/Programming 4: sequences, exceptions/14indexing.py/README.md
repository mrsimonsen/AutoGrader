# Instructions
Objective: Learn slicing and indexing strings.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for a message.
2. Display the first character of the message.
3. Display the last character of the message.
4. Display the middle character of the message, rounding down.
5. Display every 3rd character of the message on a new line.
6. Display the message reversed on a new line.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
What is your message?
This is my message
The first character of the message is: T
The last character of the message is: e
The middle character of the message is: y
Every 3rd character of the message:
Tssyea
The message reversed:
egassem ym si sihT
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
