# Instructions
Objective: Learn the string method split, the list method join, and the random method shuffle.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for a message.
2. Split the message into a list of words. Display the number of words in the message.
3. Shuffle the list of words, then join them back into a sting. Display the new message.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
What is the message to scramble?
This is my message.
There are 4 words in the message.
Here's the shuffled message:
my message. This is
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs. This program generates random numbers, your output will vary. I set the seed value for the tests so that the numbers will always be the same.*
