# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to work with arrays: append, sum, max methods.

## Steps
1. Prompts the user 'count' times for a weight that may contain decimal places. Format the prompts like the example. Note: 'count' will change, you'll need to use a loop to pass the tests.
2. Display all entered values on a single line in list format followed by a blank line.
3. Calculate and display the total weight.
4. Calculate and display the average weight to a precision of 2 decimal places.
5. Display the max weight.
6. Expand the program so the exception is handled when the user doesn't enter in a number, without increasing the count.


The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter weight 1:
10
Enter weight 2:
25.6
Enter weight 3:
a
That wasn't a number.
Enter weight 3:
156.7
Enter weight 4:
350
Enter weight 5:
280.16
You entered: [10.0, 25.6, 156.7, 350.0, 280.16]

Total weight: 822.46
Average weight: 164.49
Max weight: 350.0
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
