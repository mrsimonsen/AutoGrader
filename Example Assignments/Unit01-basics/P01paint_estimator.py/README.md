# Instructions
Project 1

## Steps
1. Prompt the user to input a wall's height and width. These will not always be whole numbers so store them appropriately.
2. Calculate and output the wall's area.
3. Calculate and output the number of gallons needed to paint the wall. Assume that a gallon of paint covers 350 square feet.
4. Calculate and output the number of 1 gallon paint cans needed to paint the wall. Hint: use the imported math function to round up to the nearest gallon.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter wall height (feet):
12
Enter wall width (feet):
15.5
Wall area: 186.0 square feet
Paint needed: 0.5314285714285715 gallons
Cans needed: 1 cans
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
