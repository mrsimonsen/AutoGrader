# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to get input and cast data types.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user to input a string, an integer, and a float storing each into separate variables. Output a newline after each input.
2. Extend the program to output those values on a single line separated by a space starting with a blank line.
3. Add another output line that displays the previous output in reverse.
4. Add a line that casts the float to an integer, and outputs it.
5. Finally, add a line that displays the string in lowercase, UPPERCASE, and Title Case all separated by spaces.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter a string:
Howdy
Enter an integer:
14
Enter a float:
3.77

Howdy 14 3.77
3.77 14 Howdy

3.77 cast to an integer is 3.
howdy HOWDY Howdy
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
