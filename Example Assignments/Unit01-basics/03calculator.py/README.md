# Instructions
Objective: Learn how do math in Python.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for two numbers and store them as integers.
2. Display a message similar to "Doing math for num1 and num2." where num1 and num2 are replaced with the respective integer values. End with a blank line.
3. Expand the program to display the listed mathematical expressions on the two integer variables.
4. Round the output of "Division" so that it always displays 3 decimal places.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter a number:
1
Enter a second number:
8
Doing math for 1 and 16.

Addition = 9
Subtraction = -7
Multiplication = 8
Exponent = 1
Division = 0.125
Floor Division = 0
Modulus Division = 1
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
