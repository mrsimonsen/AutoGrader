# Instructions  
Objective: Learn how to display output to the screen in Python.

## Steps
1. Output "Hello World!" to the screen.
2. Extend the output to include "NUAMES" on a new line.
3. Have the third line be "CS", but start it with a tab character.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Hello World!
NUAMES
	CS
```
*Note: Your spacing may differ due to what you have the "Indent size" set to in Settings.*
