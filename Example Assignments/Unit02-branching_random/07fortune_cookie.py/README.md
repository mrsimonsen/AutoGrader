# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to use compound conditions.

## Steps
1. Display the opening line.
2. Generate a random number from a range of 10. Set branching according to the table below. Compound conditions must be used for credit. If multiple conditions are true, then multiple fortunes should print. Each fortune should start with a tab character.

Fortune | Random Number
 -- | --
You are not illiterate. | 3, 4
Cookie said: "You really crack me up." | 2, 9
Help! I'm being held prisoner in a fortune cookie bakery! | 5, 6, 7
You will read this and say "Geez! I could come up with better fortunes than that!" | 0, 1, 5
This cookie is never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down. | 0, 1, 2, 8, 9


The output of the program should look like the following:
```
You crack open your cookie and your fortune falls out:
	You are not illiterate.
```
*Note: This program generates random numbers, your output will vary. I set the seed value for the tests so that the numbers will always be the same.*
