Project 3

## Steps
1. Display a greeting to the user and display the provided grade categories and percentages. Each category starts with a tab character and the head is left justified to 10 characters. Be sure to use the variables for the percentage because they will change in the tests.
2. Prompt the user for the percentage earned from each category as a whole number.
3. Calculate the overall grade and assign a letter based on the following table. Display the final grade.

Letter | Percentage
 :--: | :--:
F | <60%
D | >=60% <70%
C | >=70% <80%
B | >=80% <90%
A | >=90%

The output of the program should look like the following:
