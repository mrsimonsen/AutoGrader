# Instructions
Objective: Learn the string method replace().

## Steps
1. Copy then modify the code from assignment 06text_msg_decoder so that instead of expanding the acronyms that exist in the message they're replaced in the original message.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter text:
You entered: Totally JK! TTYL BFF

Found "BFF", replaced with "best friend forever"
Found "JK", replaced with "just kidding"
Found "TTYL", replaced with "talk to you later"

Expanded: Totally just kidding! talk to you later best friend forever
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
