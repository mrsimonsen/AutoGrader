2. Check the message for the acronyms in the table below. If the acronym exist in the message, output a expansion. If multiple acronyms exist in the message, all of them should output a expansion. Begin the expansion message with a tab character.

 BFF | best friend forever
 IDK | I don't know
 JK | just kidding
 TMI | too much information
 TTYL | talk to you later

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter text:
IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday.
You entered: IDK if I'll go. It's my BFF's birthday.
	BFF: best friend forever
	IDK: I don't know
