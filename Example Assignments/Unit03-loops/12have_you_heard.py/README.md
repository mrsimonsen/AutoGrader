# Instructions
Objective: Lean how to use while loops.

## Steps
1. Ask the user if they've ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise.
2. Until the user's response isn't "yes" or "y", keep displaying the tragedy and asking the user again. Use the format from the example.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
no
I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a
Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so
powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the
midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark
side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some
consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he
was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he
did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew,
then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save
others from death, but not himself.
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?
yes
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
