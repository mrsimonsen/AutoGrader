# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to use for loops and the break statement.

## Steps
1. Create a variable that holds a string of all the vowels.
2. Prompt the user for a message.
3. Find and display the first vowel, and only the first vowel, in the message.


The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter a message:
May the force be with you!
The first vowel is "a".
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
