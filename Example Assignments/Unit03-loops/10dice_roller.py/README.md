# Instructions
Objective: Learn the range function.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for two integers; a number of dice to roll and the number of sides those dice have. Display a message stating how many of what sided dice are being rolled.
2. Display each dice roll.
3. Display the total of all the dice rolls.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
How many dice would you like to roll?
8
How many sides do the dice have?
6
Rolling 8x d6.
Roll 1: 6
Roll 2: 6
Roll 3: 3
Roll 4: 6
Roll 5: 3
Roll 6: 6
Roll 7: 5
Roll 8: 5
Total: 40
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs. This program generates random numbers, your output will vary. I set the seed value for the tests so that the numbers will always be the same.*
