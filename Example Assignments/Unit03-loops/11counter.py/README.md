# Instructions
Objective: Learn how to use the optional paramaters of the range function.

## Steps
1. Prompt the user for 3 integers; a starting number, ending number, and step (count-by) number.
2. Output a message verifying the count.
3. Display each number in the count on a single line, separated by spaces. **This means that the line will end with a trailing space.**
4. Expand the program to display the ending number, if applicable.

The output of the program should look like the following:
```
Enter starting number:
1
Enter ending number:
10
Enter step number:
1
Counting from 1 to 10 by 1:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
*Note: This program outputs a newline after each input and the example show the user's input, but that actually isn't part of the output when the program runs.*
