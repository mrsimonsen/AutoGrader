# Instructions
Objective: Learn about reading from files.

## Steps
1. Copy the code from assignment 08 and modify it according to the following:
	* The main function should take in a string which will be the name of the file where the message is contained.
	* Read the whole contents of the file to a string
	* Replace the abbreviations listed in assignment 8, but without any output.
	* Write the expanded message to a file called "expanded.txt"

This program does not output anything.
